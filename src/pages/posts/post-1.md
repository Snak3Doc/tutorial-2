Welcome to my _new blog_ about learning Astro! Here, I will share my progress as i build my website and add content to it

## What I've completed so far

2. **Creating a New Project**: I used npm create Astro@latest to create a new Astro template.
3. **Making New Pages**: I learnt how to add new pages to the website and add buttons to navigate between them.
4. **Making My First Blog Post**: I made this blog post your reading right now!

## What's Next?
I will continue working through the Astro tutorial and finish my personal blog.
